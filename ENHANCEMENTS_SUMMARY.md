## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Add Deadline Enforcement in Controllers
Controllers that need deadline checks:
- `app/Http/Controllers/Web/SubjectController.php` - Before create/store
- `app/Http/Controllers/Web/SubjectPreferenceController.php` - Before managing preferences
- `app/Http/Controllers/Web/TeamController.php` - Before team operations
- `app/Http/Controllers/Web/AllocationController.php` - Before viewing allocations

Example implementation:
```php
public function create()
{
    $deadline = AllocationDeadline::active()->first();

    if (!$deadline || !$deadline->canStudentsChoose()) {
        return redirect()->back()->with('error', __('app.deadline_passed'));
    }

    // Continue with form display
}
```

### 2. Add Page Descriptions to Key Views
Views that need multilingual descriptions:
- `resources/views/subjects/index.blade.php` - Browse subjects page
- `resources/views/teams/index.blade.php` - Teams management page
- `resources/views/teams/create.blade.php` - Team creation page
- `resources/views/preferences/index.blade.php` - Manage preferences page
- `resources/views/dashboard/index.blade.php` - Role-specific guidance
- `resources/views/defenses/index.blade.php` - Defense schedule page

### 3. Add Required Translation Strings
Add to `resources/lang/en/app.php`, `fr/app.php`, and `ar/app.php`:

```php
// Page Descriptions
'create_subject_page_title' => 'Create a New Subject Proposal',
'create_subject_page_description' => 'Fill in all required fields to propose a new project subject. Make sure your title is clear and your description is comprehensive.',
'basic_information' => 'Basic Information',
'fill_all_required_fields' => 'Please fill all required fields marked with *',
'create_new_subject' => 'Create New Subject',

// Page descriptions for other views
'subjects_page_description' => 'Browse and search available project subjects. Filter by grade, status, or keyword to find the perfect project.',
'teams_page_description' => 'Manage your team membership and view other teams. Join a team or create your own to start selecting subjects.',
'preferences_page_description' => 'Select and prioritize up to 10 subject preferences for automatic allocation based on your academic performance.',
```

### 4. Apply Enhanced Styles to Other Forms
Forms that should be updated:
- `resources/views/teams/create.blade.php`
- `resources/views/subjects/edit.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/users/create.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/rooms/create.blade.php`

Pattern to follow:
1. Add page description at top
2. Wrap in form-card class
3. Add form-section dividers
4. Use form-control-lg for all inputs
5. Add icons to labels
6. Use btn-lg for all buttons
7. Add enhanced validation feedback
